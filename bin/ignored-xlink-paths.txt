# Used by checkGMLFiles.py to determine which xlink:href paths are ignored in the validation process
# This is used to permanently exclude some paths, as well as temporarily keep WMO Codes registry paths from
# failing validation during development until they can be made operationally available

# Permanent exclusions
http:\/\/codes\.wmo\.int.*observation-type.*
http:\/\/codes\.wmo\.int.*observable-property.*

# Temporary exclusions (to be re-enabled once available, ideally before the release is issued)
